## Architecture Overview

The project is in early development (Phase 1 of 3). The architecture follows a component-based Unity pattern. Scripts are organized by domain:

```
Assets/Scripts/
├── Player/           # VR player movement, grab, interaction
├── Tools/            # Tool usage logic (hammer, drill, saw)
├── Machines/         # CNC, conveyor, robotic arm logic
├── UI/               # Control panel UI + machine panels
├── GameState/        # Task progression, scoring, feedback
└── Utilities/        # Editor helpers, mesh utilities
```

> Only `Player/` and `Utilities/` exist so far. All other folders are planned.

## Existing Scripts

### `Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs`
- **Type:** `MonoBehaviour`, requires `CharacterController`
- **Purpose:** Desktop-mode fly camera for editor testing. WASD + Q/E movement, mouse look with pitch clamping, cursor lock toggle.
- **Status:** Placeholder — will be replaced or wrapped by a VR XR Rig controller.
- **Known issue:** Uses legacy `Input` class, inconsistent with project's New Input System setting. Do not extend this pattern — use `InputSystem` actions from `Assets/Settings/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions` instead.

### `Assets/Scripts/Utilities/JoinMeshes.cs`
- **Type:** `MonoBehaviour`
- **Purpose:** On `Start()`, combines all `MeshFilter` components in children into one merged mesh, then deactivates child objects. Used for draw call reduction on static geometry.
- **Status:** Utility — no changes needed.

## Planned Script Systems

Each system below maps to a planned folder and set of scripts. When implementing, create scripts in the correct folder and follow the naming conventions shown.

### 1. VR Player Movement & Interaction (`Scripts/Player/`)
VR locomotion and hand interaction using XR SDK. Replaces `PlayerController.cs` for VR builds.

Key scripts to create:
- `VRPlayerController.cs` — XR Rig movement (teleport / continuous)
- `HandInteractor.cs` — grab detection, ray interactor, haptic feedback
- `GrabSystem.cs` — handles pickup, hold, release of interactable objects

**Dependencies:** Unity XR Interaction Toolkit (`com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit`) — not yet in manifest, must be added.

---

### 2. Tool Usage Logic (`Scripts/Tools/`)
Defines behavior when tools are used.

Key scripts to create:
- `HammerTool.cs` — nail driving, surface detection, finger-hit safety reaction
- `DrillTool.cs` — rotation, contact detection
- `SawTool.cs` — cutting plane, material splitting
- `ToolBase.cs` — abstract base class shared by all tools

**Pattern:** Tools should use events (`UnityEvent` or C# `Action`) to notify game state and feedback systems. Avoid direct coupling between tool scripts and UI.

---

### 3. Game States & Task Progression (`Scripts/GameState/`)
Linear task flow: the player completes steps in order. Each step has entry conditions, a goal, and an exit trigger.

Key scripts to create:
- `TaskManager.cs` — singleton, holds current task state and step index
- `Task.cs` — serializable data class describing a single task (name, description, goal type)
- `TaskStep.cs` — individual step within a task, with completion condition
- `GameStateEvents.cs` — static event bus for state changes

**Pattern:** Use a scriptable object per task (`Task.asset`) so designers can configure steps without code changes.

---

### 4. Machine Control Panels (`Scripts/UI/` and `Scripts/Machines/`)
World-space UI panels attached to machines.

Key scripts to create:
- `ControlPanel.cs` — base class; manages button press events, display state
- `CNCControlPanel.cs` — extends `ControlPanel`; exposes speed, axis, start/stop controls
- `ConveyorControlPanel.cs` — belt speed, direction toggle
- `PanelButton.cs` — physical VR-pressable button with press/release events

**Pattern:** Panels communicate with their machine via interface (`ICNCMachine`, `IConveyor`), not direct MonoBehaviour references.

---

### 5. CNC Cutting System (`Scripts/Machines/`)
Controls the CNC router: positioning, cutting pass, result mesh generation.

Key scripts to create:
- `CNCMachine.cs` — state machine (Idle → Positioning → Cutting → Done)
- `CNCCutter.cs` — moves the tool head along a path, triggers cut events
- `WoodCutResult.cs` — spawns or deforms result mesh after a cut
- `CuttingPath.cs` — scriptable object defining cut geometry (line, curve, pocket)

**Pattern:** The CNC uses a state machine enum. External systems (panel, task manager) call `CNCMachine.StartCut()` and listen to `CNCMachine.OnCutComplete`.

---

### 6. Conveyor & Object Transfer (`Scripts/Machines/`)
Moves objects between machines automatically or on trigger.

Key scripts to create:
- `ConveyorBelt.cs` — applies velocity to objects on the belt surface via `OnTriggerStay`
- `TransferPoint.cs` — destination marker; fires event when an object arrives
- `ObjectSpawner.cs` — spawns wood blanks at the start of the conveyor

---

### 7. Scoring, Feedback & Consequence System (`Scripts/GameState/`)
Tracks score, delivers feedback (audio, visual, haptic), applies penalties.

Key scripts to create:
- `ScoreManager.cs` — singleton, tracks score and error count
- `FeedbackManager.cs` — plays sounds, particle effects, and haptic pulses
- `SafetyEvent.cs` — data class representing a safety violation (type, severity, penalty)
- `ConsequenceSystem.cs` — listens for safety events, applies slowdowns or retries

**Pattern:** Use a centralized event bus. Tools and machines raise events; `FeedbackManager` and `ConsequenceSystem` respond independently.

## 3D Models (Assets/Models/)

| Model | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNC Machine | `CNC2.fbx` | Main CNC router — needs control panel attachment points |
| Control Panel | `ControlPanel.fbx` | Currently a mesh only — no scripts yet |
| Conveyor | `Conveyor.fbx` | Belt conveyor — needs `ConveyorBelt.cs` |
| Robotic Arm | `RoboticArm.fbx` | Phase 2 — joints need rigging for animation |
| Screen | `Screen.obj` | Display surface for panel UI |
| Table | `Table.fbx` | Workbench |

## Third-Party Assets

Do not modify anything under `Assets/ThirdParty/`. These are imported packages.

| Pack | Path | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| CoolWorks Carpentry Tools | `ThirdParty/CoolWorks_Studio/Carpentry_Tools/` | Hand tools: axe, chisel, drill, saw, plane, rasp (FBX + PBR textures) |
| Factory Tools | `ThirdParty/FactoryTools/` | Hammer, nail, wrench, screwdriver, shelf, workbench (FBX) |
| Free Industrial Models | `ThirdParty/FreeIndustrialModels/` | Pallet, pallet jack, wood planks (FBX + PBR textures) |
| LeartesStudios Coffee Shop | `ThirdParty/LeartesStudios/` | HDRP demo scenes — reference for interior lighting only, not for use in URP build |
| Urban American Assets | `ThirdParty/UrbanAmericanAssets/` | Paint booth scene — reference only |

---

## Render Pipeline Notes

- Pipeline: **URP 17.3.0**
- All materials must use URP-compatible shaders (`Universal Render Pipeline/Lit`, `Universal Render Pipeline/Simple Lit`, etc.)
- The `LeartesStudios` assets use HDRP shaders — they will appear pink in this project. Do not use them in the main scene.
- Render pipeline assets are in `Assets/Settings/`. The active asset is `PC_RPAsset.asset`.

---

## Input System Notes

- The project uses the **New Input System** (`com.unity.inputsystem` 1.17.0).
- The input action map is at `Assets/Settings/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`.
- **Do not use** `UnityEngine.Input` (legacy). Use `InputAction`, `InputActionReference`, or generated C# classes from the `.inputactions` asset.
- `PlayerController.cs` currently uses legacy input — this is a known inconsistency and will be replaced by the VR controller.

---

## Code Conventions

### Naming
- Classes: `PascalCase` — `CNCMachine`, `HandInteractor`
- Methods: `PascalCase` — `StartCut()`, `OnGrabBegin()`
- Private fields: `camelCase` with underscore prefix — `_currentState`, `_speed`
- Public serialized fields: `camelCase` — `moveSpeed`, `cuttingDepth`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` — `MAX_CUT_DEPTH`
- Events: `On` prefix — `OnCutComplete`, `OnTaskCompleted`

### Structure
- One class per file
- Scripts go in the correct domain folder (see Architecture Overview above)
- Use `[Header("...")]` and `[Tooltip("...")]` on all serialized fields
- Use `[SerializeField] private` instead of `public` for inspector-exposed fields
- Use `RequireComponent` where a dependency is mandatory

### Events
- Prefer C# `Action` / `Func` for internal communication between scripts
- Use `UnityEvent` for inspector-wired connections (e.g. button press → machine start)
- Use a static event bus (`GameStateEvents.cs`) for global cross-system notifications

### Performance (VR Critical)
- Target: 72 fps minimum (90 fps preferred) on Meta Quest
- Avoid `FindObjectOfType` at runtime — cache references in `Awake()`
- Avoid `Update()` polling where events can be used instead
- Keep draw calls low — use GPU instancing on repeated objects (nails, planks)
- Use LODs on all high-poly models
- Profile with Unity Profiler before and after any new system
